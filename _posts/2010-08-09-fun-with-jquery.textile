Here is a little jquery script to webpackize all the images in your page:

bc. <script type="text/javascript" src="neoip_webpack.js"></script>
<script>
	neoip_webpack.ready(function(){
		$("img").each(function(){
			this.attr("src", webpackize(this.attr('src')) );
		})
	});
</script>

Pretty simple no ? And now all your images will be downloaded with p2p speed.

It would be as simple to webpackize flash object or video source.
