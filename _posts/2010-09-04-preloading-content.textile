In some cases, it may be interesting to preload content in webpeer. For example, to reduce initial latency or improve cache flushing. <!-- give details on the cases --> For this purpose, i added @webpeer-preload@ in <em>webpeer-utils</em>. This tool will communicate with <em>webpeer</em> and asks it to preload URLs. The URLs are passed as command line parameters.

{% highlight bash %}
webpeer-preload http://example.com/video.webm http://example.com/song.ogg
{% endhighlight %}

After this command, this webpeer will share the content of <em>video.webm</em> and <em>song.ogg</em>. Thus if another web peer access those urls, this webpeer will help it.
