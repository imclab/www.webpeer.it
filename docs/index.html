	<h1>WebPeer.js</h1>
	webpeer.js is webpeer binding for javascript.
	Those bindings give easy access to webpeer features from javascript. So there are two
	versions of the binding, <a href="/blog/2010/08/09/webpeer-binding-for-the-web">one for the web</a>
	and one <a href="/blog/2010/08/24/webpeer-binding-for-nodejs">one for nodejs</a>. This is the same
	code as they are both in javascript, only the paint changes.
	Btw <b>webpeer.js</b> is included in this page, so you can experiment live with it.
	Just open the javascript console and copy/paste the examples of this page in it.
	
	<h1>webpeer.ready(callback)</h1>
	It starts a detection of webpeer. It notifies the callback on completion.
	use webpeer.present() to get the result.
	Here is a little example:
	<br/>
{% highlight javascript %}
webpeer.ready(function(){
	console.log("webpeer has been probbed.");
});
{% endhighlight %}
	
	<h1>webpeer.present()</h1>
	It returns <b>true</b> if webpeer has been detected, <b>false</b> otherwise.
	Do a webpeer.ready() before to get meaningfull results.
	Here is a little example:
	<br/>
{% highlight javascript %}
webpeer.ready(function(){
	console.log("webpeer is "+(webpeer.present()?"detected": "not detected"));
});
{% endhighlight %}

	<h1>webpeer.url(url)</h1>
	It webpeerifies an url to a file. If webpeer has not been detected the url is returned as is.
	Do a webpeer.ready() before to get meaningfull results.
	This url convertion to webpeer is minimal for simplicity.
	<br/>
{% highlight javascript %}
webpeer.ready(function(){
	var url	= "http://example.com/livecd.iso";
	console.log(url+" webpeerified to "+webpeer.url(url));
});
{% endhighlight %}

	<h1>webpeer.badge(element_id)</h1>
	Generate a dynamic badge of webpeer. It is web-only function. a busy wheel is displayed
	during the detection, if detected it is replaced by a green checkmark, else it is
	replaced by a red cross.
 	<br/>
{% highlight javascript %}
webpeer.badge("webpeer_badge");
{% endhighlight %}

	<h1>Examples</h1>
	Some examples are also available <a href="/blog/2010/08/24/webpeer-binding-for-nodejs/">from nodejs</a>
	or <a href="/blog/2010/08/09/webpeer-binding-for-the-web/">from webpages</a>.
	If you wish, you can look at the whole api <a href="jsdoc">jsdoc reference</a> (the output is strange... im not sure im doing it right).
