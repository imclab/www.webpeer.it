	<h1>Who am i ?</h1>
	<p>
		Webpeer is a single-man job by me, <a href="http://jetienne.com">jerome etienne</a>.
		I left my fulltime job, went in a basement for several years and came up
		with this (and other things, stay tuned). I tried to make a
		startup out of it, but failed. Well, so be it, shit happens, you know.
	</p>
	<p>
		All this hard work ending up wasted in a drawer ? no way!
		I am giving it to the world. Opensource ftw, baby!
