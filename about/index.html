	<h1>What is Webpeer ?</h1>
	<p>
		Webpeer unifies the web technology with p2p ones.
		Webpeer boosts your internet for free.
		It seamlessly unifies web and p2p to leverage the best both worlds.
		It is opensource and cross plateform.
		Its design makes it <em>efficient</em>, <em>robust</em> and <em>transparent</em>.
		It provides, among other things, <em>faster downloads</em>, <em>more reliable content
		delivery</em> and <em>reduced server load</em>. All that while being <em>transparent
		for content</em> and <em>software</em>.
	</p>
	<h1>Who am i ?</h1>
	<p>
		Webpeer is a single-man job by me, <a href="http://jetienne.com">jerome etienne</a>.
		I left my fulltime job, went in a basement for several years and came up
		with this (and other things, stay tuned). I tried to make a
		startup out of it, but failed. Well, so be it, shit happens, you know.
	</p>
	<p>
		All this hard work ending up wasted in a drawer ? no way!
		I am giving it to the world. Opensource ftw, baby!
